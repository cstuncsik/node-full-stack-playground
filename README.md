### Playing around without angular

# Nodejs


**Start mongodb**

```
mongod
```

**Install dependencies**
```
npm i
```

**Import data from json to mongodb**

```
npm run import
```

**Export data from mongodb to json**

```
npm run export
```

**Start development**
```
npm run dev
```

*You can open the app at http://localhost:3000*

**Build production**

```
npm run build
```

**Serve production**

```
npm run serve
```

*You can open the app at https://localhost:3443*

# Docker

If you don't want to install mongodb or different version of nodejs
and you have docker already installed just run the commands below

**Create a docker container**

```
docker build --force-rm=true -t playground .
```

**Start docker container in production mode**

```
docker run --rm -it -p 443:3443 playground
```

**Start docker container in development mode**

```
docker run --rm -it -p 3000:3000 -v /home/cstuncsik/projects/node-full-stack-playground:/home/node/app playground dev 
```

*On windows the path setting is a little different*

```
docker run --rm -it -p 3000:3000 -v //c/Users/cstuncsik/projects/node-full-stack-playground:/home/node/app playground dev
```
